                    <P>A front-end web developer is probably what most people think of as a “web developer”. A front-end web developer is responsible for implementing visual elements that users see and interact with in a web application. They are usually supported by back-end web developers, who are responsible for server-side application logic and integration of the work front-end developers do.</P>
